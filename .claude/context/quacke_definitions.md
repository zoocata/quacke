# 🧠 Quacke Application Glossary

A reference guide to all major terms, files, and concepts used in the **Quacke** system.

---

## Core Concepts

### **Quacke**
A Windows GUI tool that manages the creation, configuration, and deployment of Quake III Arena CPMA server instances across multiple remote VPSs. It automates file generation, synchronization, and startup scripts for seamless remote management.

### **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**
A remote Linux server that hosts one or more Quake 3 Arena server instances. In Quacke, each VPS acts as an independent host environment.

### **VPS Profile**
A folder within Quacke’s `/profiles/` directory that represents one VPS. It stores the VPS’s SSH connection details (`meta.json`) and all related server instance configuration files.  
**Example:** `/profiles/crackshack-east/`

### **meta.json**
A JSON file within a VPS profile that stores connection settings such as hostname/IP, username (usually `root`), password, and any additional metadata for deployment.

## Server Structure

### **Server Instance**
A single running Quake 3 CPMA server process on a VPS. Each instance has its own config, name, and startup scripts.  
**Example:** “server_1”, “CTF-West”, or “Instagib-Test”

### **Instance Config (.json)**
A local JSON file (stored in the VPS profile folder) that defines settings for one server instance — including map rotation, max players, hostname, rcon password, etc.  
**Example:** `/profiles/crackshack-east/server_1.json`

### **Server Config (.cfg)**
A text-based configuration file that the Quake 3 engine reads to apply game rules, map lists, and mod settings. Quacke auto-generates this file for each instance during deployment and places it in `/root/cpma/cpma` on the VPS.

### **Advanced Settings**
Additional `server.cfg` parameters that can be edited per instance through the GUI’s Advanced Settings window — allowing customization beyond basic options (like frag limits, time limits, and vote settings).

---

## Scripts and Execution

### **Start Script (`start_server_<name>.sh`)**
A shell script generated by Quacke that launches a Quake 3 server instance on the VPS inside a screen session.  
**Location:** `/root/cpma/start_server_<name>.sh`

### **Stop Script (`stop_server_<name>.sh`)**
A shell script that gracefully stops a specific server instance by killing its running process or screen session.

### **Restart Script (`restart_server_<name>.sh`)**
A script that sequentially stops and restarts the same instance. Used when updating maps or configs without full redeployment.

### **Server Executable**
The Quake 3 engine binary (e.g., `ioq3ded.x86_64`) that runs dedicated servers. On first setup, Quacke prompts you to select this file and uploads it to each VPS during deployment.

## Game Data & Files

### **CPMA Folder**
The root directory containing Quake 3 and CPMA mod data.  
**Example structure on the VPS:**

/root/cpma/
├── baseq3/ (maps and assets)
├── cpma/ (mod files and configs)
└── quacke_out/ (generated files)


### **baseq3 Folder**
Contains maps (`.bsp`), textures, and other standard Quake 3 assets. 

### **cpma Folder**
Holds mod files (e.g., `gamex86.so`, `pakfiles`, and configs). Quacke-generated `server.cfg` files are uploaded here.

### **quacke_out Folder**
A safe subdirectory inside the CPMA folder where Quacke writes all generated files locally (before deployment). This prevents overwriting original game data.

### **Map Pool**
A list of maps the server rotates through during gameplay. Quacke detects changes to the map pool and uploads only modified or newly added map files.

### **Classes Folder**
Contains editable configuration files for CPMA’s player classes:  

/classes/
fighter.cfg
scout.cfg
sniper.cfg
tank.cfg

Each file defines class stats and abilities. Quacke allows editing and deploying these per instance. 

---

## Deployment

### **Deploy**
The process of uploading generated configs, scripts, class files, and the server executable to the VPS for the first time. 

### **Redeploy**
Reuploads changed or newly created .cfg files and restarts server executables using shell screen commands.

---

## GUI & Workflow

### **Instance Selector**
The dropdown menu in the Quacke GUI that allows users to switch between server instances under the active VPS profile.

### **Save Profile**
Commits all in-memory changes in the GUI (VPS settings, instance configs, advanced options) to disk.

### **Deploy Button**
Begins synchronization between local Quacke files and the remote VPS, using change detection to minimize unnecessary uploads.

### **Server Status Sidebar**
A live or refreshable GUI panel showing real-time data from the selected VPS — including running servers, player count, map name, and uptime.

---

## Utilities

### **list_running_servers.sh**
A user-provided script on the VPS that displays all currently active Quake 3 server instances and their runtime data.

### **RCON (Remote Console)**
A Quake 3 network protocol allowing admins to send console commands to the server remotely, such as changing maps or kicking players. Each instance has its own RCON password in the config.

### **Screen Session**
A persistent terminal session that allows a Quake 3 server to run in the background on the VPS, even when you disconnect from SSH.
